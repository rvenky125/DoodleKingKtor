## Doodle King Ktor api for Doodle King KMM app.
I rebuilt this backend based on Philipp Lackner's [doodle kong api](https://github.com/philipplackner/ktor-doodlekong.git) for backend. I have used the **Ktor** in this project. If you are new to Ktor please go through: https://ktor.io/

You need run this project to use it as a backend service for Doodle King KMM application.
You just need to find the [Application.kt](src/main/kotlin/com/famas/Application.kt) file and click on the run button as shown below.
